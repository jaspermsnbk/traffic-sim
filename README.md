## prototyping phase 1

Split traffic into 2 problems

problem 1

for C given connections, L given lanes in each connection, and average flow, what is the optimal intersection type?

general types

light:
- N protected left turns
- M protected right runs

Roundabouts:
- L lanes

Problem 2:
given a traffic network, where Nodes are the intersections and roads are the edges, how do we determine weak points and what is the MCS (Minimal Change Solution) for those chokepoints.
